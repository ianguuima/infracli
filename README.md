# infra-cli, a quick deployer to your infra command line tool

I've been working on apps and side-projects for a while, and I always wanted a way to create a simple deploy
to the cloud, where I wouldn't need to execute docker push commands to a repository, or even to configure the deploy on my server.

Infracli solves this problem, it can easily build an image, tag and push to an image repository and deploy it on a server.
